# Pabau Internship Tasklist

This project showcases my completion of the Pabau Kosovo L.L.C Internship tasks. It consists of a monorepo structure with separate folders for JavaScript, React, and TypeScript (optional) tasks.

## Task Requirements

### JavaScript Folder Task

Inside the JavaScript folder, I demonstrated my proficiency in manipulating DOM elements by creating a form with checkbox inputs. The form allows for shuffling values, changing values, and displaying selected checkboxes on the screen.

### React Folder Task

In the React folder, I developed a Next.js app with a landing page. The app includes a step-by-step process, where users can select options and navigate between different pages. The current step is displayed in the header.

### TypeScript Folder Task (Bonus)

Inside the TypeScript folder, I established the required types and interfaces. This includes descriptions for Interns, Juniors, and the Company, with attributes such as names, ages, skills, and domains.

## Project Structure

- `monorepo/JavaScript`: Contains the JavaScript task files.
- `monorepo/React`: Holds the React or Next.js app for the React task.
- `monorepo/TypeScript` (optional): Contains the TypeScript task files.

## Getting Started

To run the code and explore each task, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the specific task folder within the `monorepo` directory.
3. Follow the instructions provided in each folder's README file to run and test the code.
